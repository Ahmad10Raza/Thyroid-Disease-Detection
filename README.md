## Introduction

Thyroid diseases are common and can have a significant impact on a person's health. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can predict the presence of thyroid disease based on specific medical features, such as T3, T4, and TSH levels.

The repository contains the code necessary to train the model, as well as a pre-trained model for immediate use. Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook is provided to demonstrate the step-by-step process of training the model.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmad10Raza/Thyroid-Disease-Detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   cd Thyroid-Disease-Detection
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Go To
    ```bash
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```
4. Fill Required Information then click `Predict`
   
## Usage

To use the pre-trained model and make predictions, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (see [Installation](#installation)).

2. Run the `predict.py` script:

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

   This will prompt you to enter the values for the medical features (T3, T4, and TSH levels) and display the predicted outcome.

For a detailed overview of the training process and how to use the code, refer to the `Thyroid_Disease_Detection.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Data

The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can find the dataset used in the project at [link-to-dataset](https://example.com).

## Model
